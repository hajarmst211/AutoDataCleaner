This project relies on a ETL pipeline (extract, transform, load). It takes raw csv files and transform them into clean data files ready to use into a structured storage system.  

# Improvements:
- Make a json or yaml file from whom the cleaner script take  informations about the cleaning: implementation methode, .... and then the cleaner script does the cleaning based on that.
